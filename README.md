# newsletter

Mist.io newsletter template built with:

- [Foundation for Emails](http://foundation.zurb.com/emails.html)
- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)

If you want to export the html file with inline css you have to install npm dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

From now on every time you make some changes simply run:

```bash
grunt
```

A file named `inlined.html` is created. This is the only file you need in mailchimp.
